            <h2>Early Life and Birth</h2>
            <img src="shiva3.jpg" alt="Shivaji Maharaj's Birthplace - Shivneri Fort" width="500" height="500">
            <p>Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj was born on February 19, 1630, at Shivneri Fort in present-day Maharashtra. His father, Shahaji Bhosale, was a respected general serving under the Deccan Sultanates, while his mother, Jijabai, was a deeply religious and visionary woman who played a crucial role in shaping his character. Since Shahaji was often away due to military campaigns, Jijabai raised Shivaji, instilling in him values of courage, justice, and leadership through stories of great Hindu warriors and epics. From a young age, he received training in warfare, administration, and diplomacy, developing a deep sense of duty toward his people. Growing up in the rugged terrain of Shivneri, he observed the hardships faced by the local population, which ignited his determination to establish an independent kingdom. This vision took its first step toward reality when, at just 15 years old, he captured Torna Fort, marking the beginning of his extraordinary journey.</p>

            <img src="shiva5.jpg" alt="Shivaji Maharaj's Vision of Swarajya" width="500" height="500">
            <p>Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj's vision of Swarajya (self-rule) was deeply rooted in the idea of creating an independent, just, and people-centric kingdom free from foreign oppression. He dreamt of a sovereign Hindu state where his subjects, irrespective of caste or religion, could live with dignity and security. Unlike the exploitative rule of the Mughals and Deccan Sultanates, Shivaji envisioned a governance system based on justice, equality, and efficient administration. He promoted local self-governance, strengthened the economy, and implemented policies that protected the rights of farmers, traders, and soldiers. His concept of Swarajya was not just about political independence but also about cultural revival, economic prosperity, and military strength, making the Marathas a formidable power in India. His relentless efforts and sacrifices in achieving this goal continue to inspire generations to fight for self-reliance and good governance.</p>

            <img src="shiva6.jpg" alt="Shivaji Maharaj's Military Tactics" width="500" height="500">
            <p>Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj was a master strategist who revolutionized warfare with his innovative guerrilla tactics, often referred to as Ganimi Kava in Marathi. Understanding the strengths and weaknesses of his enemies, he used the rugged terrain of the Sahyadri mountains to his advantage, launching swift, surprise attacks on enemy forces and retreating before they could counterattack. This method allowed his smaller, agile forces to defeat much larger and well-equipped armies.</p>
            <p>He also focused on fort warfare, capturing and strategically strengthening forts like Rajgad, Raigad, Pratapgad, and Sinhagad, which served as secure bases for his operations. His navy was another significant achievement, making the Marathas a dominant force along the Konkan coast and protecting their territories from foreign invaders like the Portuguese, Siddis, and the Mughals.</p>
            <p>Shivaji’s military organization was highly disciplined, with strict codes of conduct ensuring that civilians were not harmed during raids. His emphasis on speed, intelligence gathering, and unconventional warfare helped him outmaneuver much larger forces, making him one of the most brilliant military leaders in Indian history. His strategies laid the foundation for Maratha dominance and were later adopted by many freedom fighters in India.</p>
